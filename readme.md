## Computer's Eye.
### What is this repo about?
- In this repo i share all my learnings of computer vision and projects that i made to deepen my understanding of computer vision.
- Computer vision is a growing field with huge applications in repetitive visual calculation intensive tasks.
- I am particularly interested in its applications in ```medical science and sports analytics.```
- Other than learning about the models, i am also interested in deploying these models.

### Why am i doing this?

- It is fascinating to see a machine able to do 'tasks' which seem impossible.
- Well I think humans are lazy and if I can make a machine do critical stuff then we don't have to rely on humans.
    - critical stuff includes:
        - disease detection
        - finding criminals
        - collecting evidence
        - monitoring kids in nurseries.



### What topics i am exploring?
I am focussing on making complete projects that are deployed and used in real world.
- Technology:
    - mediapipe
    - skimage
    - openCV
    - Yolo
    - ultralytics
    - Roboflow
